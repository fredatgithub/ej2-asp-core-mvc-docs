## Load and Save the spreadsheet data as Base64 string in client side in Spreadsheet Control

Currently spreadsheet donâ€™t have direct option to save the data as Base64 string. However, this can be achievable by saving the spreadsheet data as `Blob data` and convert that saved blob data to `Base64 string` using `FileReader`. To get the Blob data in [`saveComplete`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/syncfusion.ej2.spreadsheet.spreadsheet.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Spreadsheet_Spreadsheet_SaveComplete) event, you need to set the `needBlobData as true` and `isFullPost as false` in [`beforeSave`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/aspnetcore-js2/syncfusion.ej2.spreadsheet.spreadsheet.html#Syncfusion_EJ2_Spreadsheet_Spreadsheet_BeforeSave) event.

The following code example shows how to load and save the spreadsheet data as Base64 string in client side.

{% if page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-core" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight cshtml tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/base-64-string/tagHelper %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="OpenController.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/base-64-string/opencontroller.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% elsif page.publishingplatform == "aspnet-mvc" %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="CSHTML" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/base-64-string/razor %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# tabtitle="OpenController.cs" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/base-64-string/opencontroller.cs %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% endif %}
